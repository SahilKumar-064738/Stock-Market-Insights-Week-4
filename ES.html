      <h1>The Enron Scandal: Corporate Fraud and Collapse</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Enron scandal, which came to light in late 2001, is one of the most
        infamous cases of corporate fraud in modern history. It led to the
        bankruptcy of Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in
        Houston, Texas. Once the seventh-largest company in the United States,
        Enron's downfall was caused by a series of fraudulent accounting
        practices, which misled investors, employees, and the public. This
        scandal ultimately resulted in significant changes to corporate
        regulations and accounting practices, as well as the dissolution of the
        Arthur Andersen accounting firm, Enron's auditor.

      <h2>Who Was Enron?</h2>
      <p>
        Enron was founded in 1985 by Kenneth Lay as Lay Company, later renamed
        Enron Corporation. It started as a natural gas pipeline company but soon
        expanded into trading energy contracts, becoming a giant in the energy
        sector. Enron was hailed as a model of innovation, leveraging energy
        derivatives, and setting up complex financial schemes that allowed the
        company to grow rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enron’s leadership, including CEO Kenneth Lay, COO Jeffrey Skilling, and
        CFO Andrew Fastow, was central to its rise. They embraced an aggressive,
        speculative business model that included trading in energy futures and
        the use of complex financial instruments such as Special Purpose
        Entities (SPEs) and off-balance-sheet transactions.
      </p>

    <section id="how-the-fraud-was-perpetrated">
      <h2>How the Fraud Was Perpetrated</h2>
      <p>
        Enron's fraudulent activities involved complex accounting practices and
        a network of off-balance-sheet entities designed to hide massive debt
        and inflate profits. These Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) were set up
        to move Enron’s liabilities off its balance sheet, giving the illusion
        of a financially healthy company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enron’s management, led by CFO Andrew Fastow, instructed the company’s
        auditors at Arthur Andersen to ignore the risks associated with these
        SPEs, allowing Enron to keep them hidden from shareholders and
        regulators. This gave investors the false impression that Enron was
        incredibly profitable, while in reality, it was racking up billions in
        debt.
      </p>

    <section id="the-collapse">
      <h2>The Collapse of Enron</h2>
      <p>
        The fraud began to unravel in late 2001 when Enron’s stock price began
        to fall sharply. As Enron's financial situation worsened, questions
        about the company's accounting practices surfaced, and the firm’s use of
        SPEs was exposed. In November 2001, Enron announced it would restate its
        financial statements for the previous four years, revealing that the
        company had overstated its profits by nearly $600 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the revelation of the accounting discrepancies, Enron’s stock
        plummeted, and the company filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001.
        This bankruptcy, which involved over $63 billion in debt, was the
        largest in U.S. history at that time.

    <section id="impact-of-the-scandal">
      <h2>Impact of the Scandal</h2>
      <p>
        The Enron scandal had far-reaching consequences. Thousands of employees
        lost their jobs and their retirement savings, many of whom had invested
        heavily in Enron stock. The company’s collapse also caused a ripple
        effect across the financial industry, leading to a loss of confidence in
        corporate governance and accounting practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enron’s bankruptcy also led to the downfall of Arthur Andersen, one of
        the five largest accounting firms in the world at the time. The firm was
        found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding Enron-related
        documents, effectively destroying its reputation and leading to its
        disbandment.
      </p>

    <section id="legal-consequences">
      <h2>Legal Consequences for Enron Executives</h2>
      <p>
        Following the bankruptcy, several of Enron’s top executives faced
        criminal charges. Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling were both convicted
        on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. Lay died in 2006 before he
        could be sentenced. Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison but had
        his sentence reduced to 14 years after an appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew Fastow, Enron’s former CFO, was sentenced to six years in prison
        after pleading guilty to charges of fraud and money laundering. The
        scandal also led to a wave of regulatory reforms, most notably the
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which aimed to improve corporate governance,
        increase transparency, and prevent accounting fraud.

    <section id="lessons-learned">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        The Enron scandal highlighted the dangers of unchecked corporate power,
        poor regulation, and a lack of transparency in financial reporting. It
        underscored the importance of independent auditing and the need for
        strong ethical standards in corporate governance. Additionally, it
        showed the critical need for more rigorous oversight of financial
        markets and accounting practices to protect investors and prevent future
        frauds of such magnitude.
