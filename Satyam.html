    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Satyam Computer Services scam, often referred to as India’s "Enron
        moment," was a massive corporate fraud that took place in 2009. Satyam,
        one of India's leading IT services firms, was caught in a financial
        scandal that involved the company's chairman, Ramalinga Raju, inflating
        the company's financial statements to mislead shareholders, auditors,
        and regulators. This led to the collapse of the company, a significant
        loss of investor confidence, and severe regulatory changes in India’s
        corporate governance.

      <h2>Who Was Ramalinga Raju?</h2>
      <p>
        Ramalinga Raju was the founder and chairman of Satyam Computer Services,
        a company that was once one of India’s top IT outsourcing firms. He
        started the company in 1987, and under his leadership, Satyam became one
        of the most prominent names in the IT sector. Raju was known for his
        business acumen and the company's rapid growth, but behind the success
        was a web of deceit that ultimately led to the downfall of both Satyam
        and Raju's personal reputation.

      <h2>How the Fraud Was Perpetrated</h2>
      <p>
        The Satyam scam was a classic case of financial misreporting, where Raju
        and his associates artificially inflated the company’s financial
        figures. The key methods used to perpetuate the fraud included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Falsification of Revenues:</strong> Raju inflated the revenue
          figures by booking non-existent sales and creating fictitious
          accounts, which made the company appear far more profitable than it
          actually was.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overstating Cash Reserves:</strong> He also overstated the
          company's cash and bank balances by inflating the numbers in the
          company’s financial statements. This was done by creating fake bank
          statements that were presented to auditors and investors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fabricating Assets:</strong> The company’s balance sheet was
          also manipulated by showing fictitious assets, further misleading
          investors and stakeholders about the true financial health of the
          company.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="the-revelation">
      <h2>The Revelation of the Scam</h2>
      <p>
        The scam was exposed in January 2009 when Ramalinga Raju wrote a letter
        to the company’s board of directors admitting that he had falsified the
        financial statements. In his confession, Raju stated that he had
        overstated the company's profits and financial standing by over ₹7,000
        crore (roughly $1.5 billion). The revelation sent shockwaves through the
        Indian stock market, leading to a sharp fall in Satyam’s stock prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the admission, the Indian government took swift action by
        suspending the company’s stock, and the Securities and Exchange Board of
        India (SEBI) launched an investigation into the matter.

      <h2>Impact of the Scam</h2>
      <p>The Satyam scam had several far-reaching consequences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collapse of the Company:</strong> Satyam, which was once
          valued at over $7 billion, collapsed under the weight of the scandal,
          and the company's stock value plummeted, wiping out billions in market
          capitalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Investor Losses:</strong> Thousands of investors lost their
          money as Satyam’s stock price fell sharply, leaving many to wonder how
          they were misled for years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Corporate Governance Crisis:</strong> The scam exposed the
          flaws in corporate governance practices in India and led to a loss of
          confidence in the country’s regulatory mechanisms. It raised questions
          about the role of auditors and their failure to detect the fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> The Indian government and the
          Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) implemented stricter
          regulations in response to the scandal to enhance corporate
          transparency and strengthen auditing standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="legal-consequences">
      <h2>Legal Consequences for Ramalinga Raju</h2>
      <p>
        Following the revelation of the fraud, Ramalinga Raju was arrested and
        charged with a series of crimes, including financial fraud, forgery, and
        embezzlement. He faced intense legal scrutiny and was convicted for his
        role in the scam.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, Raju and several of his associates were sentenced to 7 years in
        prison, although their sentences were later appealed and reduced. The
        Satyam scam remains one of the most infamous corporate frauds in Indian
        history.

          statements.
        </li>
        <li>
