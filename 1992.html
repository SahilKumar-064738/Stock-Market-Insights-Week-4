      <h1>The Harshad Mehta Scam: India's Biggest Stock Market Fraud</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Harshad Mehta scam, which took place in the early 1990s, is one of
        the most infamous financial frauds in Indian history. Harshad Mehta, a
        stockbroker, exploited loopholes in the Indian banking system to
        manipulate the stock market, leading to a massive loss of wealth for
        investors and triggering a nationwide financial crisis. The scandal not
        only exposed the lack of regulation in India’s financial markets but
        also highlighted the vulnerabilities in the banking system.

      <h2>Who Was Harshad Mehta?</h2>
      <p>
        Harshad Mehta was a stockbroker who gained significant prominence in the
        Indian financial world during the 1980s and early 1990s. He was known as
        the 'Big Bull' of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) due to his ability to
        influence the stock market. His meteoric rise in wealth and power led to
        him being considered a financial genius, but his downfall came when his
        fraudulent activities were uncovered.

      <h2>How the Fraud Was Perpetrated</h2>
      <p>
        Harshad Mehta exploited a loophole in the banking system known as the
        "ready forward deal" to manipulate stock prices. He used the funds he
        siphoned off from banks to artificially inflate the prices of specific
        stocks, creating a false impression of the market's strength. Here’s how
        the fraud unfolded:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ready Forward Deals:</strong> Mehta used a financial
          instrument called "ready forward deals" to obtain large sums of money
          from various public sector banks without proper documentation. He used
          these funds to buy large quantities of stocks, particularly in the
          Bombay Stock Exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manipulation of Stock Prices:</strong> Mehta used the money
          obtained from the banks to manipulate the prices of stocks,
          particularly in the blue-chip stocks, by creating an artificial
          demand. This inflated the stock prices, leading to massive profits for
          him and his associates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Money Laundering:</strong> The funds he obtained through the
          manipulation were laundered through a complex network of shell
          companies, further hiding the fraudulent transactions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Collapse of Harshad Mehta</h2>
      <p>
        The scam came to light in April 1992, when a journalist named Sucheta
        Dalal published an exposé revealing how Mehta had used bank funds to
        manipulate the stock market. The authorities, including the Reserve Bank
        of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI),
        began investigating the matter. It was soon discovered that Mehta had
        misappropriated over ₹5,000 crore (roughly $1.5 billion) from public
        sector banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the revelation of the fraud, the stock market collapsed, and
        Mehta's empire crumbled. He was arrested in 1992, and several of his
        associates were also taken into custody. However, Harshad Mehta remained
        defiant, claiming that he had not done anything wrong. He was later
        convicted but spent only a few years in prison due to various legal
        complexities.

      <h2>Impact of the Scam</h2>
      <p>
        The Harshad Mehta scam had a far-reaching impact on India's financial
        markets and its regulatory framework. Some of the major consequences
        were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stock Market Collapse:</strong> The revelation of the scam
          caused the stock market to crash, with the BSE Sensex losing over 50%
          of its value in a matter of weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Banking System Vulnerabilities:</strong> The scam exposed
          major weaknesses in the banking system, particularly in how funds were
          being transferred between banks without proper checks and balances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loss of Investor Confidence:</strong> The scandal shook the
          trust of retail investors in the Indian stock market, as many had
          invested their life savings in stocks manipulated by Mehta.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulatory Reforms:</strong> The government and regulators,
          including SEBI, took immediate steps to tighten regulations in the
          stock market, leading to reforms that aimed at increasing transparency
          and investor protection.
        </li>

      <h2>Legal Consequences for Harshad Mehta</h2>
      <p>
        Harshad Mehta was arrested in 1992, and after a prolonged legal battle,
        he was convicted for his role in the scam. He was charged with numerous
        offenses, including fraud, misappropriation of funds, and market
        manipulation. He spent a few years in jail, but he was granted bail in
        1994 due to health issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the charges against him, Harshad Mehta remained a controversial
        figure. While some saw him as a victim of the system, others believed he
        had single-handedly brought the Indian stock market to its knees.
